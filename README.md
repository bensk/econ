# 9<sup>th</sup> Grade Economics 

<p>We begin by examining problems in terms of the <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/econ101/FactorsOfProduction.html">Factors of Production</a>: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>We learn to see the relationships between these in terms of <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/econ101/SupplyDemand.html">supply and demand</a>. We learn as Economists to think of cost as <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/econ101/OpportunityCost.html">Opportunity Cost</a>, a measure of what is <em>sacrificed</em> in order to get what we want.</p>
<p>We see how <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/econ101/SupplyDemandCaseStudy.html">supply and demand work in the market to set prices</a>, for everything from sneakers to oil.</p>
<p>We follow the economic history of the United States, beginning with <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/TheMarket/EconomicsOfColonization.html">Mercantilist conquest</a> and the <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/TheMarket/TriangleTrade.html">slave trade</a>.</p>


<p>We examine the <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/FiscalDebates/AlexanderHamilton.html">economic debates at the founding of the United States</a>, and the extraordinary contributions of “a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean.”</p>
<p>We learn the little-known <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/FiscalDebates/SlaveryInNewYork.html">history of the slave market and racial violence in New York City</a>.</p>
<p>We learn about <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/FiscalDebates/Sharecropping.html">Sharecropping and Jim Crow</a>, economic and political systems designed to keep African Americans subservient agricultural labor in the wake of the Civil War.</p>
<p>We follow African-Americans as they <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/FiscalDebates/TheGreatMigration.html">journeyed North</a>, looking for a better life. We see the reality of their <a href="http://bsk.education/econ/FiscalDebates/ChicagoRaceRiot.html">arrival</a>.</p>


<p style="font-size: 1.4em">We follow immigrants and migrants, slaves and free people, some driven from their homes and some desperate seeking a place to call their own.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.4em">From the beginning, prosperity in North America was extracted from stolen land, by the forced labor of stolen peoples. It is a history of plunder. </p>
