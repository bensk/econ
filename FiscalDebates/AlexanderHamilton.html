<blockquote><p>Born out of wedlock, raised in poverty in St. Croix, abandoned by his father, and orphaned by his mother as a child, Hamilton transplanted himself as an adolescent to a New York City filled with revolutionary fervor. An eloquent and prolific writer, he was the author of two-thirds of the Federalist Papers; after serving as George Washington’s aide during the Revolutionary War, he became America’s first Treasury Secretary.</p>

<p>Later, Hamilton achieved the dubious distinction of being at the center of the nation’s first political sex scandal, after an extramarital affair became public. He never again held office, and before reaching the age of fifty he was dead, killed in a duel by Aaron Burr, the Vice-President, after a personal dispute escalated beyond remediation.</p><footer><cite><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/hamiltons">All about the Hamiltons</a></cite> - Rebecca Mead</footer></blockquote>

<div class="caption">There was a war, but it was not Hamilton's greatest battle.</div>

<!-- <h3>The Battle over the Bank</h3>

<p>After months of battling and compromises, the US Constitution was finally adopted on September 17, 1787. Still, America was embroiled in heated arguments over exactly how the government would work and what powers it could really exercise. Political parties soon developed as groups argued about the direction of the country. Alexander Hamilton became a leading voice of the <mark>Federalists</mark> who believed that the federal government needed to be strong. On the other side, Thomas Jefferson, a <mark>Republican</mark>, argued that too much power in the hands of the federal government would lead to tyranny.</p>

<img class="img-responsive thumbnail" src="FiscalDebatesResources/cabinetBattle2.jpg">

<p>The <mark>necessary and proper clause</mark> part of Article I of the Constitution allowed for Congress to make laws and provisions that were not part of the enumerated powers. Hamilton and Jefferson debated many times over what was meant by “necessary and proper.” Hamilton took a more liberal reading of the clause and said that Congress should do <mark>anything</mark> it felt was necessary to carry out national responsibilities. Jefferson held that the clause meant that Congress should <mark>only</mark> take actions that were absolutely necessary, and no more.</p>

<p>In 1791, Hamilton proposed that the United States charter a national bank in order to take care of Revolutionary War debt, create a single national currency, and  stimulate the economy. Jefferson argued that the creation of a national bank was not a power granted under the enumerated powers, nor was it necessary and proper. Both gentlemen presented their arguments to President Washington...</p>

<p>“I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground: That "all powers not delegated to the United States, by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States or to the people." To take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn around the powers of Congress, is to take possession of a boundless field of power, no longer susceptible of any definition.” </p>

<p>“The incorporation of a bank, and the powers assumed by this bill, have not, in my opinion, been delegated to the United States, by the Constitution.” </p>

<p>“To "regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the States, and with the Indian tribes." To erect a bank, and to regulate commerce, are very different acts.”</p>

<p>“It would reduce the whole instrument to a single phrase, that of instituting a Congress with power to do whatever would be for the good of the United States; and, as they would be the sole judges of the good or evil, it would be also a power to do whatever evil they please.” </p>

<p>“The second general phrase is, "to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the enumerated powers." But they can all be carried into execution without a bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase.” </p>

<p>“This restrictive interpretation of the word necessary is also contrary to this sound maxim of construction; namely, that the powers contained in a constitution of government, especially those which concern the general administration of the affairs of a country, its finances, trade, defence etc. ought to be construed liberally, in advancement of the public good.”</p>

<p>“It is not denied that there are implied well as express powers, and that the former are as effectually delegated as the latter.”</p>

<p>“The proposed bank is to consist of an association of persons, for the purpose of creating a joint capital, to be employed, chiefly and essentially, in loans. So far, the object is not only lawful, but it is the mere exercise of a right which the law allows to every individual.”</p>

<p>“Accordingly, it is affirmed, that it [the bank] has a relation, more or less direct, to the power of collecting taxes; to that of borrowing money; to that of regulating trade between the States...”</p>

<p>“And in the last place, it will be argued, that it is clearly within the provision which authorizes the making of all needful rules and regulations concerning the property of the United States, as the same has been practised upon by the Government.”</p>

<p>“To deny the power of the Government to add this ingredient to the plan, would be to refine away all government.”</p>
