<blockquote>
<p>I pick up my life, And take it with me, </p>
<p>And I put it down in Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, Scranton, </p>
<p>Any place that is North and East, And not Dixie.</p>
<p>I pick up my life And take it on the train, </p>
<p>To Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Seattle, Oakland, Salt Lake </p>
<p>Any place that is North and West, And not South.</p>
<p>I am fed up With Jim Crow laws, </p>
<p>People who are cruel And afraid, Who lynch and run, </p>
<p>Who are scared of me And me of them</p>
<p>I pick up my life And take it away On a one-way ticket </p>
<p>Gone up North Gone out West Gone!</p>

	<p>In what period of time in U.S. history is this poem set? How can you tell?</p> 
	<p>What were the Jim Crow laws to which the speaker refers?</p> <p>How does this poem help people today understand life in the South versus life in the North and West for African-Americans at that time?</p></div>

	<p>The Great Migration, or the relocation of more than 6 million African Americans from the rural South to the cities of the North, Midwest and West from 1916 to 1970, had a huge impact on urban life in the United States.</p> 
	<p>Driven from their homes by unsatisfactory economic opportunities and harsh segregationist laws, many blacks headed north, where they took advantage of the need for industrial workers that first arose during the First World War. As Chicago, New York and other cities saw their black populations expand exponentially, migrants were forced to deal with poor working conditions and competition for living space, as well as widespread racism and prejudice. </p>
	<p>During the Great Migration, African Americans began to build a new place for themselves in public life, actively confronting economic, political and social challenges and creating a new black urban culture that would exert enormous influence in the decades to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6" style="font-size: .8em">
	<p>After the post-Civil War Reconstruction period ended in 1876, white supremacy was largely restored across the South, and the segregationist policies known as Jim Crow soon became the law of the land. Southern blacks were forced to make their living working the land as part of the sharecropping system, which offered little in the way of economic opportunity, especially after a boll weevil epidemic in 1898 caused massive crop damage across the South.</p>
	<p>And while the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) had been officially dissolved in 1869, it continued underground after that, and intimidation, violence and even lynching of black southerners were not uncommon practices in the Jim Crow South.</p>
	<p>Around 1916, when the Great Migration began, a factory wage in the urban North was typically <mark>three times more</mark> than what blacks could expect to make working the land in the rural South.</p>
</div>

	<img src="FiscalDebatesResources/GreatMigration.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">
	<br>
	
<p>By the end of 1919, some 1 million blacks had left the South, usually traveling by train, boat or bus; a smaller number had automobiles or even horse-drawn carts. In the decade between 1910 and 1920, the black population of major Northern cities grew by large percentages, including New York (66 percent) Chicago (148 percent), Philadelphia (500 percent) and Detroit (611 percent).<sup id="fnref:Migration">
